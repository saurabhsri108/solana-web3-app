# Solana dAPP

Solana programs are stateless. They don't hold data permanently. This is very different from the world of Ethereum smart contracts — which hold state right on the contract.
Solana programs can interact w/ "accounts".
Again, accounts are basically files that programs can read and write to. The word "accounts" is confusing and super shitty. For example, when you create a wallet on Solana — you create an "account". But, your program can also make an "account" that it can write data to. Programs themselves are considered "accounts".
Everything is an account lol. Just remember an account isn't just like your actual wallet — it's a general way for programs to pass data between each other.
